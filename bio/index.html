      <h3> Southwestern College Helpdesk Student Tech. <h3> 
        <h3> Student Journalist for <i> The Collegian. </i> <h3>

      <p> I assist in the day to day operation of our Helpdesk. 
        I ensure issues regarding the student laptops offered by our laptop program are operating smoothly. 
        I assist in various other troubleshooting and technological issues. <em> Generally, I’m the guy people 
        come to after hours when they have a laptop problem they don’t know how to fix. </em> </p>
       
        <p> I have had personal opinion stories, professional photos and serious columns published in our 
          collegiate newspaper, The Collegian. I have also had stories and photos posted on our website for 
          various events. In addition, I help maintain and run two organizations on campus. I am the president 
          of Gaming Club and the Vice President of eSports. We have game nights on the last Friday of every 
          month, so feel free to come and join us! </p>
        
        <p> I am from Macksville, KS. Back home, I have my mother and father to thank for all the support, as 
          well as three siblings who I get to see on holidays.I am a thrower for the Track and Field team and 
          I throw all five implements. In my spare time you will find me listening to music and drawing or play 
          video games between my classes. Although I enjoy listening to any genre, I listen specifically to 
          rock, folk and ska. Dispatch is currently my favorite band, as they can be a combination of all three, 
          or none of them at the same time. </p>
        
        <p> I am a junior majoring in computer science and digital arts. 
          Feel free to reach out to me at taylor.rodriguez@sckans.edu. </p>
